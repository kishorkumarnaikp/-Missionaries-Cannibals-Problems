Best First Sench (Informed, Heuristic)

## Algorithm:

Let OPEN be a priority queue containing
  initial state.
  Loop
    if OPEN is empty return failure
    Node <- Remove-Fist (OPEN)
    if node is a Goal
    then reform the Path from initial to Node
else generate all successions of Node and
    Put the newly generated Node into OPEN
    according to their f(heuristic value) values in increasing order
  END LOOP
